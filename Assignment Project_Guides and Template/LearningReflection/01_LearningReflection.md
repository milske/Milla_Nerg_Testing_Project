> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?

- I had nice experience of testing the website and reporting about it. It was my first time to do something like this, and it was a good way to get some insight to testing apart from the theory.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.

- For each test case, according to the title, I made the steps in the website in order to describe and test the whole process.

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management.

- I have used previously Jira and Trello for task management, I think those tools are quite good.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?

- I have used Visual Studio Code. I have previous experience with this tool and it is easy to use and have lot of options/extensions to choose from.

## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?

- At first, this assignment seemed somehow complicated but the instructions were really clear so it was easy to fill the assignment step by step.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?

- No trouble. I have used Github before in programming courses so I was familiar with uploading files to my Github account.

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )

- I'm not sure which framework or language I would use. Probably the most recommended one and easy to use, or the one that have good tutorials to follow along.

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing

- Proficiency in test automation tools (e.g., Selenium, Cypress, Robot Framework).
  -Experience with programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, or JavaScript).
  -Knowledge of API testing tools (e.g., Postman, SoapUI).
  -Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines and tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI.
  -Strong understanding of Agile and Scrum methodologies.
  -Soft skills like analytical thinking, communication, and collaboration.

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?

- I would need to learn about the automation tools and programming languages like Python/Java. I do already have knowledge of JS and API testing tools like Postman and I have some understanding of Agile and Scrum methods. I believe my soft skills are in pretty good shape: communication and collaboration with the team.

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas?

-The theory part was really extencive and I feel I would need to recap some of it to get a better understanding of some of the topics. I would have liked more practical exercises on this course, I think that is a better way to learn, to combine theory with the practice. This last assignment was interesting and gave a good idea how testing really would be like.
